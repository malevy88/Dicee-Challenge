# Dicee-Challenge

This challenge was all about using the DOM to change and manipulate the dice and the H1 heading. Upon hitting refresh, the dice change to a random generated number and the 
H1 let's you know who the winner is. My JS code is by no means the best practice method but it's a step in showing how I've been able to learn some problem solving techniques
using JS.
